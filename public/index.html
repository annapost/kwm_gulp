    Claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? jump on human and sleep
    on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not
    waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans soft kitty warm kitty
    little ball of furr. Groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous
    for the rest of the day - checked attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim jumps off balcony gives owner dead
    mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass
    finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks
